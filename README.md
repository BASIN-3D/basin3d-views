Simplified methods to view basin3d model objects

![basin3d-views](https://github.com/BASIN-3D/basin3d-views/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)

BASIN-3D is a software ecosystem that synthesizes diverse earth science data 
from a variety of remote data sources on-demand, 
without the need for storing data in a single database. It is designed to parse, 
translate, and synthesize diverse observations from well-curated repositories into 
standardized formats for scientific uses such as analysis and visualization.

basin3d-views is a BASIN-3D Library that provides simplified methods to view and query
basin3d model objects
